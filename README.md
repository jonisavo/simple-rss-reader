# simple-rss-reader

I created the initial version of this application in three days for a quick React Native course. I decided to keep working on it because I want to use a simple and minimal RSS reader.

## Some things to do
- Cache feeds. Right now, only the feed URLs are saved into AsyncStorage. I want to save articles as well to avoid fetching feeds all the time.
- Implement removing feeds. Right now, you can only add feeds. I want to build some sort of simple UI for removing them (like long-pressing on a feed to open options).
- OPML support.
- Eject into a bare workflow. While Expo's managed workflow is convenient, I want to challenge myself and have more control over my application. (Also, it's probably the best way to decrease the app size.)
- Make it prettier. It looks fine right now, but could be much better.
